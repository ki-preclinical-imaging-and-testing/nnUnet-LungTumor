Lung and Tumor prediction model

Trained on ~600 cases

achieved 0.88 Dice, which is very good

model saved in 
nnUnet-LungTumor/nnUnet_results/Dataset001_LungTumor/nnUNetTrainer__nnUNetPlans__3d_fullres/fold_0/


BEFORE YOU RUN:
make sure all the data is 
	-256x256x256
	-In the correct orientation
	-scaled to HU

TO RUN:
open up terminal

1. Activate environment (not necessary but useful to ensure longevity)
	go to : /home/ascott/Documents/Jupyter-sandbox/nnUnet-LungTumor/
	run : source nnUet/bin/activate
	open the file exports
	export those variables in terminal (run the following):
	
	# raw data, unpreprocessed
	export nnUNet_raw="[Not important for inference]"

	# data, processed into pkl files
	export nnUNet_preprocessed="[Not important for inference]"

	# results, where the model is stored
	export nnUNet_results="[directory/where/you/stored/the/model]"
	
2. Navigate to the folder of scans you want to analyze
	
3. Make sure scans are in a single folder and create a folder for predictions
	Scans must be in the form 
		[image folder]/img_[number]_0000.nii.gz
		
4. In terminal, run the following:
	nnUNetv2_predict -i [image folder] -o [output folder] -f 0 -d 1
	
	Note:
	-f is fold. The model is trained on a 5 crossfold validation
	and 0 means that the first chunk was used for validation and the rest were
	used for training
	-d is dataset 1, the dataset that was used to train lung and tumor segmentations
	
ALTERNATIVE OPTION:
1. If you images are saved as a folder with individual .tif files inside, open PredictTumorFromTifs.py

2. Navigate to lines 250, 251 and edit to point to the folder and model

3. Run the following in terminal:
	python3 -m PredictTumorFromTifs.py
